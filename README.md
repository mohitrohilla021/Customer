# Customer-segmentation- for market resource- allocation.

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits.

Companies employing customer segmentation operate under the fact that every customer is different and that their marketing efforts would be better served if they target specific, smaller groups with messages that those consumers would find relevant and lead them to buy something. Companies also hope to gain a deeper understanding of their customers' preferences and needs with the idea of discovering what each segment finds most valuable to more accurately tailor marketing materials toward that segment.

We apply "customer segmentation" on the historical data of the customers, that gives the basic required details about the customers.

Customer segmentation is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics.
It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources.
For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, that is, more likely to purchase products, or subscribe for a service. 

A business task is to retain those customers. Another group might include customers from non-profit organizations.

This project helps a lot in the market-resource allocation to the specific customers.
