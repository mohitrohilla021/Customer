# Customer-segmenation- for market resource- allocation.

We apply "customer segmentation" on the historical data of the customers, that goves the basic required details about the customers.

Customer segmentationÂ is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics.
It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources.
For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, that is, more likely to purchase products, or subscribe for a service. 

A business task is to retaining those customers. Another group might include customers from non-profit organizations.

This project helps a lot in the market-resource allocation to the specific customers.
